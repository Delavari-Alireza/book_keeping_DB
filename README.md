![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

## Overview

Welcome to the "Book Keeping System" project developed using Flask. This project serves as an implementation for a book keeping system as part of a database course. It encompasses various phases, including proposal, database design, and implementation using Flask, to provide a comprehensive solution for efficient book keeping.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Proposal (In Persian)**
   - This folder contains the proposal document detailing the project's scope, objectives, and initial plans. 

2. **Phase 2: EER Diagram**
   - The EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) diagram, representing the conceptual database design, is available in this folder. 

3. **Phase 3: Database Tables**
   - Here, you'll find the SQL scripts to create the necessary database tables based on the EER diagram. 

4. **Phase 4: Flask Codes**
   - This folder houses the Flask application codes that implement the book keeping system. 

## Installation and Setup

To run the Flask application and explore the book keeping system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alireza499/book_keeping_DB.git`
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended).
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure the database connection details in the Flask application.
5. Run the Flask development server: `flask run`
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the book keeping system.
